    <h2>The Best Movies According to Cj</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Kingsman: The Secret Service</h3>
    <p>
      This is my all time favorite movie because it is brilliantly executed<br />
      character developments, to sending out some very positive messages to<br />
      society, and a very funny, but threatening villain, here's why
      Kingsman:<br />
      The Secret Service can be regarded as the best in Vaughan's infamous
      franchise.
    </p>
    <h3>Avengers: The End Game</h3>
    <p>
      The Marvel Cinematic Universe has put out some of the best superhero<br />
      movies of all time. While most of its movies are beloved by its fans,<br />
      Avengers: Endgame holds a special place in fans' hearts. As one of the<br />
      highest-grossing superhero movies of all time, Endgame represents the<br />
      end of an era for the MCU.
    </p>
    <h3>The Amazing Spider-man 1</h3>
    <p>
      The Amazing Spider-Man films give us the absolute best that Spider-Man has
      to<br />
      offer as Garfield's performance hits it out-of-the-park, with a
      willingness to go to<br />
      deep and dark places to express Peter's inner turmoil, masking his pain
      with a<br />
      comics-accurate, comedic approach to crime-fighting.

    <h2>The streamer's list of top 5 shows is constantly changing</h2>

    <p>
      The Netflix list of the top 15 most streamed shows has had a big
      shake-up<br />

      recently. Not only have some new additions climbed the list (hello,
      Queen<br />
      Charlotte) but the streamer has also finally been a bit more upfront about
      its<br />
      viewership data.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see, Netflix only used to release how many hours a show had been
      viewed<br />
      for during their first 28 days on the platform. Now, we can see how many
      hours<br />
      it's been viewed in total, as well as how many views the show actually got
      too,<br />
      which has led to some intriguing revelations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some shows, like Squid Game still reign supreme in both metrics, while
      others<br />
      have been helped by having longer runtimes, like Stranger Thing season<br />
      4 topping the most hours viewed of an English-language show, but being
      beaten<br />
      on views by Wednesday.
